# Assignment

## Introduction
Welcome to our project repository! In this project, you'll be creating a website based on the provided design images. Before you start, make sure to read through this README for some important guidelines and tips.

## Guidelines
1. **Commit Early & Often**: Remember to commit your changes frequently. This helps in tracking progress and managing versions effectively. If you need guidance on writing commit messages, refer to the Commit Message lesson.

2. **Download Design Images**: Take a look at the design images provided in the repository. Image One showcases the full design, while Image Two highlights color schemes and fonts used.

3. **Font**: The font used in the design is Roboto.

4. **Hero Text**: This refers to the statement appearing at the top of a web page.

5. **Step-by-Step Approach**: Tackle the project one section at a time. The website comprises four main sections and a footer. Start with one section and refine it before moving on. It's recommended to begin from the top.

6. **Content before Styling**: Focus on getting all content onto the page before styling. Start with HTML, then proceed with CSS. You might need to revisit HTML while styling, but avoid switching back and forth excessively.

7. **One Stylesheet**: Use only one CSS file for this project. One stylesheet is sufficient.

8. **Flexbox Exercises**: Many elements on the page resemble those covered in our Flexbox exercises. Feel free to revisit them if needed.

9. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Don't worry about optimizing for mobile devices at this stage. Mobile responsiveness will be covered later.

10. **GitHub Repository**: Once you finish, remember to push your project to GitHub for submission.

## Conclusion
Follow these guidelines to effectively work on the project. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance. Happy coding!
